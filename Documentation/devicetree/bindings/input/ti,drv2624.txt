* Texas Instruments - drv2624 Haptics driver

Required properties:
	- compatible - "ti,drv2624" - DRV2624
	- reg -  I2C slave address
	- ti,reset-gpio - GPIO to reset the device

Optional properties:
	- ti,irq-gpio - GPIO to receive the interrupt
	- ti,voltage-comp - Voltage compensation for any resistive losses in the
	  driver IC.
	- ti,ol-lra-frequency - LRA frequency for open-loop mode
	- ti,bemf-factor - Sets the feedback gain for closed-loop operation
	- ti,bemf-gain - Sets the analog gain of the back-EMF amplifier
	- ti,blanking-time - Time waiting for BEMF to settle. Before ADC
	  sampling
	- ti,idiss-time - Sime waiting for inductor current to discharge
	- ti,zc-det-time - Zero crossing detection time
	- ti,lra-wave-shape - Selects which shape to use for driving the LRA
	  when in open loop mode. 0 - Square Wave, 1 - Sine Wave.
	- ti,waveform-interval - Sets the internal memory playback interval to
	  either 5 ms or 1 ms. 0 - 5 ms, 1 - 1 ms.

Example:

drv2624: drv2624@5a {
	compatible = "ti,drv2624";
	reg = <0x5a>;
	ti,reset-gpio = <&tlmm 95 0>;
};
